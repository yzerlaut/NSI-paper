* Introduction

During wakefulness, epochs corresponding to various levels of physiological and behavioral markers, such as pupil size and locomotion, have been correlated with various membrane potential signatures in rodent sensory cortices (Polack et al., 2013; McGinley et al., 2015a; Reimer et al., 2014). Those observations led to the notion of various network states during wakefulness in neocortex (McGinley et al., 2015b; Busse et al., 2017). An emergent picture for the modulation of network activity in sensory cortices is the "U-model" of arousal (McGinley et al., 2015b): a continuum of network states characterized by various membrane potential signatures. At low arousal levels (quantified by a low pupil diameter and the absence of motor behavior), the membrane potential fluctuations exhibit a stereotypical [2,10]Hz oscillatory pattern in somato-sensory (Poulet and Petersen, 2008), auditory (McGinley et al., 2015b) and visual (Reimer et al., 2014) sensory cortices of rodents. At moderate arousal (quantified by an intermediate pupil diameter and the absence of motor behavior), single cells are hyperpolarized with low ongoing fluctuations (McGinley et al. 2015a, Reimer et al. 2014). At high arousal levels (under locomotion or and/or high pupil dilatation), the membrane potential exhibits a sustained depolarization with high-frequency $V_m$ fluctuations. 

What is the correlate of such network states in terms of extracellular potential in neocortex? And how does the graded aspect of this diversity of states (measured in terms of $V_m$ fluctuations) translate into extracellular signal ? By combining intra- and extracellular recordings in awake mice somato-sensory cortex, we address those questions in the present study.

Understanding cortical processing during wakefulness would largely benefit from a quantitative measure of network states from commonly
monitored electrophysiological signals. We provide here a Network
State Index (NSI) giving a quantitative formulation to the “U-model" of arousal in sensory cortices ([[McGinley et al., 2015b]]) from a population signal: the extracellular potential.

We first show that the extracellular potential can be transformed into a signal exhibiting a high correlation with the membrane potential of pyramidal neurons. From this signal, we can perform the classification of the low frequency and asynchronous periods with their granularity. We then estimate the accuracy of this classification by comparing them with the $V_m$-defined network states. Finally, we analyze the impact of the spectrum of network states displayed within a single recording (as captured by our measure) on the correlation between our two simultaneously recorded neurophysiological signals. We find that the variability of network states (beyond the fraction of occurrence of slow rhythmic activity) is a key factor in shaping the correlation between those signals. This finding suggest that the variability of network states during wakefulness in a given experimental setting is a major contributor to the measured correlation between different neurophysiological signals.

In the middle, we show the time-varying high-gamma power (brown thin line) and its smoothed fluctuations (brown thick line, the pLFP signal). The $p_0$ value (brown dotted line) corresponds to the 100th percentile of the pLFP signal. (b) We look for the frequency band that maximizes the correlation with the simultaneously recorded membrane potential. This is achieved by varying independently a root frequency $f$ and a width factor $w$ yielding the frequency band [$f$/$w$, $f \cdot w$]. For each frequency band, we divide the band into 20 evenly spaced wavelet frequencies, we compute the mean over frequencies of the wavelet power (resulting in the time-varying power shown in \textbf{a}) and report the cross-correlation with the $V_m$ trace (cc $V_m$-pLFP). The optimal band is found for $f_{opt}$={f0}Hz and $w_{opt}$={w0}  (c) . Testing the effect of temporal smoothing on the cross-correlation with the $V_m$ signal.

*** The time-varying high-gamma power of the extracellular potential exhibits a high correlation with the membrane potential of pyramidal neurons in awake mice S1. 

So far, the different waking states in rodent sensory cortices have been defined from their membrane potential signature ([[McGinley et al., 2015b]]). We therefore looked for a quantitative link between the extracellular signal $V_{ext}$ and the membrane potential $V_m$ fluctuations to apply such classification.

Although the the extracellular potential fluctuations can display high correlation values with the membrane potential in awake animals (cc$\sim$0.6, [[Poulet and Petersen, 2008]]), the extracellular signal is also subjected to drifts over long recordings at both slow (>1min) and fast (<10s) time scales (e.g. see the drift at the $\sim$5s time scale between episodes (i) and (ii) in Fig 1a). Its absolute value therefore does not seem to provide a reliable quantity on which one can rely to perform a robust classification. 

Guided by findings under anesthesia ([[Mukovski et al., 2006]]), we hypothesized that the high-frequency content ($f$>40Hz) of the extracellular recording would provide a good predictor of the depolarization level. We therefore apply a wavelet transform to the extracellular signal and looked for the frequency band maximizing the cross-correlation with the membrane potential of a simultaneously recorded cell (see Figure pLFPb). We found that the optimal band was achieved for $f_{opt}$={f0}Hz and $w_{opt}$={w0}, i.e. the [{F_band_min},{F_band_max}]Hz band. A temporal smoothing was found to improve the similarity with the $V_m$ signal, the optimal value was found to be $T_{opt}$={Tsmooth}ms.


*** FIGURE: The Network State Index (NSI). We derive a graded measure of network states based on the fluctuations of the pLFP signal. The index is given by the negatively-weighted low frequency power of the fluctuations (when this power overcomes the $\alpha$-dependent fluctuations-to-mean threshold) or by the smoothed mean pLFP amplitude level (when below the rhythmicity condition).

(a) Example samples of activity at different NSI levels (bottom) with their corresponding $V_m$ (top) and pLFP (middle) fluctuations. In episodes (1,2) the pLFP and $V_m$ signals exhibit low frequency activity at different powers. In episodes (3-6) the pLFP and $V_m$ signals exhibit non-rhythmic activity at various levels (in terms of both pLFP and depolarization levels). Three time-varying quantities derived from the pLFP signal are used to classify network states: a weighted estimate of the low frequency contribution to the signal, the pLFP sliding mean and the low frequency power of the pLFP signal. A consistency criterion validates a fraction of those as identified network states (brown dots).  (b) Full recording with the simultaneous variations of $V_{ext}$ (top), $V_m$ (middle) and NSI (bottom). We indicate where the (numbered) samples shown in *a* have been extracted.

(d) $V_m$ power of the [2,10]Hz band averaged across all identified Non-Rhythmic States for different values of the parameter $\alpha$. We fit the decay with an exponential function (dashed red line) and take its decay parameter as the optimal value for the classification.

We bin the NSI levels and compute the mean (plain curve) and standard deviation (shaded area) for all episodes falling within this bin. Shown for Cell 1. We highlight with grey dots the values of the single episodes visible on Figure NSIa (reproduced on the top inset, $V_m$ in black and pLFP in brown). We estimate the dependency of the $V_m$ fluctuations with a linear regression with respect to the NSI level (red dashed curve). (b) Reproducing the analysis of *a* over all n={Ncells} cells. We now consider only the mean relations over cells. We show the mean (wide curve) and the standard deviation (shaded area) across cells (N.B. evaluated only for the NSI levels displayed by multiple cells). The purple and kaki colors represent the rhythmic and non-rhythmic states respectively. For each cell, we perform a linear regression with respect to the NSI levels, we compute the mean across cells $\langle s \rangle$ and the probability of a deviation from the 0-slope hypothesis $p$ (paired t-test). Over the various Non-Rhythmic periods (kaki color), the graded variations of the pLFP signal are significantly  correlated with the mean depolarization level. On the other hand, over the various Rhythmic periods (purple color), the peak depolarization level exhibits a weak dependency on the amplitude of the pLFP power of such periods. (c) Link between $\alpha$ parameter (that sets the proportion of non-rhythmic episodes, see Figure NSIc) and the mean slope over cells (top, $\langle s \rangle_{cells}$) as well as p-value for a significant non-zero slope (bottom). The slope value weakly depends on the $\alpha$ parameter, meaning that the weak dependency on the NSI level during rhythmic episodes can not be attributed to a too low sampling of rhythmic states under the setting $\alpha=\alpha^{opt}$=2.8 used in *a* and *b*.

(a) We perform a linear-regression between cc($V_m$-pLFP) and the following statistical quantities characterizing the NSI distribution: 1) the variability $\sigma_{NSI}$ (standard deviation) of the NSI values across the whole recording, 2) the variability in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI>0}$, 3) the fraction of non-rhythmic episodes $F_{NSI<0}$, 4) the mean NSI over the whole recording, 5) the variability in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI<0}$, 6) the mean in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI>0}$, 7) the mean in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI<0}$. We show the explained variance for all quantities on the x-axis and p-value of this linear dependency. We also performed a multiple linear regression over those different components (bottom gray bar). The increased value of the multiple regression model (80\% of explained variance, adjusted $R^2$) shows that the combination of statistical features in the NSI distribution largely explain the observed variability across cells.

*** Designing a Network State Index (NSI)

After this transformation of the extracellular signal, we found that the previously evidenced $V_m$ signatures of network state ([[McGinley et al., 2015b]]) had a similar signature in terms of pLFP signal. On Figure NSIa, one can see rhythmic activity at different power as well as non-rhythmic fluctuations at various activation levels.

We describe in the following the additional signal processing step to classify network states. 

We first compute the time-varying mean $Y(t)$ of the fluctuations over a long time scale (500ms). We also compute the low frequency power of
the fluctuations $Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$ (we take the maximum to
account that rhythmicity can have varying frequencies in the [2,10]Hz
band). From this last time-varying signal, we define a weighted estimate of the contribution of the slow rhythm to the full signal $X(t) = p_0 + \alpha Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$ (shown on Figure pLFPa together with $Y$). By comparing this estimate with the sliding mean, we classify as "rhythmic" or "non-rhythmic" by computing the sign of the difference: when Y(t)-X(t) is negative, activity is classified as rhythmic, when Y(t)-X(t) is positive, activity is classified as non-rhythmic. To keep the granularity of the different network states (i.e. the amplitude of the pLFP signal, presumably the amount synaptic activity in the local network given its frequency content) in our network state index, we now weight this binary quantity by the amplitude of the pLFP signal in the two states. For the rhythmic state the amplitude of the fluctuations is given by $2 \cdot Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$. For the non-rhythmic states, the amplitude of activity is given by its deviation from the baseline level, i.e. $(Y-p_0)$. Mathematically, this is corresponds to a Network State Index (NSI) given by:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{NSI}(t) = - 2 \cdot Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz} \cdot \mathcal{H}(X-Y) + (Y-p_0) \cdot \mathcal{H}(Y-X)
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Heaviside function (i.e. step function).

The variations of the NSI quantity over some sample episodes is shown in Figure NSIa.

As the time-varying signal $\textrm{NSI}(t)$ might exhibit arbitrary fluctuations, we complement this procedure with a consistency criteria to obtain a more robust classification. We first define a network states window of T=400ms with a network state update every $T/2$=200ms. The consistency criteria requires that within a given time window of extent $T$, the fluctuations of the NSI signal remains within the noise level of the pLFP signal, here taken as the $p_0$ value. If this condition is not matched, the network state is considered as "unclassified".

Note that the motivation behind this arbitrary time scale $T$ is that it seems a good compromise to be long enough to get well defined states (e.g. at least one cycle in the [2,10]Hz range) and short enough to catch the fast and frequent switches of network states during wakefulness ([[McGinley et al., 2015b]]). 

Note also that this classification relies on the difference between the average pLFP signal $Y(t)$ and the low-frequency contribution to the signal $X(t)$ (and not on the low frequency power only) because when the pLFP signal increase its [2,10]Hz power also increases (see the power in episode (6) in Figure NSIb is equivalent to the episode (2) without exhibiting a clear rhythmicity, especially in the $V_m$ fluctuations).

*** Calibration of the rhythmicity condition

The parameter $\alpha$ weights the propensity to classify the network activity as rhythmic. This is visible on Figure NSIc, when one raises the $\alpha$ parameter, the proportion of gradually increase from $\sim$0\% at $\alpha<1$ to $\sim$100\% at $\alpha$>6. This parameter can therefore be adjusted with respect to the specific context in which the NSI is used. If an investigation focuses on slow rhythmic activity, one should be rather conservative in its determination and a low $\alpha$ parameter should be preferred (e.g. $\alpha$=2). On the other hand if an investigation focuses on asynchronous dynamics (non-rhythmic states), a higher $\alpha$ would be a conservative value (e.g. $\alpha$>3).

We nonetheless asked whether our dataset could give us an indication of the optimal value for this parameter. We used our simultaneous $V_m$ recording to find such a value. In Figure NSId, we show the mean [2,10]Hz power of the membrane potential $V_m$ as a function of the $\alpha$ parameter (after averaging over all episodes classified as rhythmic for a given cell, computed for all cells). The low frequency $V_m$ power exhibits a clear exponential decay. A natural parameter that insures a consistency between the slow-rhythmicity in the $V_m$ and in the pLFP is therefore provided by the decay constant of this decrease. We fitted this parameter and found it to be $\alpha^{opt}$={alpha_opt}. 

Indeed, for this parameter, we find a strong decrease in $V_m$ power from rhythmic to non-rhythmic states after NSI classification for all cells (paired t-test, p={pvalue_decrease_in_slow_power_Vm_synch_to_asynch}, n={Ncells} cells, see Figure NSIe). Similarly, for such a value, the $V_m$ fluctuations of rhythmic episodes exhibit a clear rhythmic shape after averaging with respect to the phase of the pLFP signal (see Figure NSIf) while the pLFP phase has a much weaker impact in the non-rhythmic episodes. The rhythmic episodes displayed a mean hyperpolarization of {mean_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch}mV from the 0-phase to the $\pi$-phase of the pLFP signal while the non-rhythmic episodes displayed an hyperpolarization of {mean_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch}mV (see Figure NSIf). Given the high variability of the depolarization at the single cycle level in both cases, {std_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch}mV for 
rhythmic episodes and {std_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch}mV for non-rhythmic episodes (variability of the hyperpolarization level over all cycles), only the rhythmic activity exhibits a high reliability of single cycle depolarization (as quantified by the mean-to-variability ratios across cycles: {mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch} for rhythmic states compared to {mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch} for non-rhythmic states, p={pval_mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi}, n={Ncells} cells, paired t-test).

Interestingly, there is another way to define an optimal classification. One can hypothesize that the most accurate/robust classification is the one that maximizes the proportion of "unclassified" states. One can see on Figure NSIc that such value is achieved for $\alpha$={alpha_opt_of_max_unclassified}, i.e. close from the  $\alpha^{opt}$={alpha_opt} estimate obtained with the above procedure.

*** Granularity of Network States: Comparison between pLFP and $V_m$ fluctuations

The above analysis investigated the mean properties of network states when classified as rhythmic or non-rhythmic. We now want to investigate the higher order quantities given by the Network State Index. To this purpose, we will now analyze the correlate in terms of $V_m$ fluctuations of the different levels of NSI. 

For non-rhythmic activity (NSI>0), we compute the mean depolarization level of a given episode as a function of its NSI level. We see on Figure Granula that the level of NSI has a strong correlate in terms of depolarization level (Pearson correlation, n={Ncells}cells, c=0.7, p=7e-12). We conclude that the granularity captured by the NSI has a correlate in terms of membrane potential level.

For rhythmic activity (NSI<0), we now compute the mean peak depolarization level (computed as the average of the single trial $Pow_{[2,10]Hz}^{max}$ value added to the baseline level $V_{m0}$) of a given episode as a function of its NSI level. Here on the other hand, the correlation is relatively weak (see Figure Granula), the granularity of the NSI has a much lower impact on the depolarization level. We conclude that the slow oscillatory pattern at various strength exhibits a more stereotypical pattern in terms of $V_m$ depolarization level than its NSI equivalent. It should be noted that the lack of graded $V_m$ response for Rhythmic activity is not related to the thresholding that reduced the NSI range of (NSI<0) intervals. When raising $\alpha$ up to 5 (where the range of NSI<0 values is much larger, because many low pLFP amplitude events are now calssified as Rhythmic, see Figure SuppGranul), the depolarization level still shows a very weak dependency to the NSI level (Figure Granulb, bottom) although it now becomes statistically significant (for $\alpha$>3, $p$<0.01, see Figure Granulb, top). On the other hand, even for 

*** An estimate of the NSI accuracy

To investigate the limitations of the above classification, we look for an estimate of the accuracy of this characterization.

Here again, we will use the comparison with the simultaneous membrane potential recordings to find such an estimate. We now apply the NSI method on the $V_m$ signal. The exact same procedure can indeed be applied without additional processing step. The lower bound of the signal $p_0$ is translated into the $V_{m0}$ value by also taking the first 100th percentile of the $V_m$ distribution (see Figure pLFPa and Figure Alla). We compute the sliding mean and the time-varying low frequency power with the same parameters as for the pLFP signal. From this we can derived the $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ quantities and therefore the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal according to Equation 1. We now compare the value of the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal during the validated network states of the "pLFP-defined NSI" signal. 

We implement a strict criteria to compare the two values. This procedure is depicted in Figure Allc for 8 cells over the n={Ncells} cells of our recording. We first determine the scaling rule $F$ between the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal ($\textrm{NSI}_{V_m}$) and the "pLFP-defined NSI" signal (($\textrm{NSI}_{\textrm{pLFP}}$)) by performing a linear fit of the data predicting either both rythmicity or both non-rhythmicity (i.e. on the lower left or the upper right of the plots in Figure Allc). Then a given time-point $t_i$ is associated to a correct network state identification if the difference between the point lies within the noise level of the pLFP signal (here taken, as before, as the baseline level of pLFP signal $p_0$), i.e. if $ \| F\big( \textrm{NSI}_{V_m}(t_i) \big) - \textrm{NSI}_{\textrm{pLFP}}(t_i) \| < p_0$. The strictness of this criteria can be seen in Figure Allc. Not only the states are taken as incorrect when there is a mismatch between the rhythmic vs non-rhythmic conditions (what happens in cells 2,4,6,7,8) but also when the granularity of the rhythmicity or the non-rhythmicity is not matched (what happens in cells 1,3,5), e.g. in cell 1, the $\textrm{NSI}_{V_m}$ value does not display a high enough value to be linearly related to $\textrm{NSI}_{pLFP}$ level according to the relationship $F$).

The final accuracy was found to be 76.6$\pm$13.2\% over the n={Ncells} cells and all classified episodes.

It should be noted that this accuracy value holds under the hypothesis that the $V_m$ classification would perfectly predict network states. Because a single pyramidal neuron samples only a finite amount of synapses, the relationship between its depolarization level and the endogenous local activity should be noisy. This estimate should therefore be interpreted as a lower bound of the method's accuracy. 

Despite those limitations, this relatively high matching value suggests that the NSI is a valid index to characterize the various network states found during wakefulness from extracellular recordings.

*** Network state variability critically contributes to correlations between $V_m$ and the pLFP signal

We now use the above index to analyze one of the peculiar feature of this dataset: namely the strong variability from recording to recording of the correlation between the $V_m$ and the pLFP signal cc-$V_m$-pLFP (see Figure pLFPc and Figure Allb).

We first look at the relationship between the average NSI over the recording and the cc-$V_m$-pLFP value (Figure 4a). We find a 0.5 correlation with a relationship close to statistical significance (p=0.1). Similarly, the occurence of rhythmic activity (NSI<0) display a similar correlation coefficient with an increased statistical confidence value (p=0.04). However, the relationship between the variability of the NSI over the whole recording (s.e.m of the NSI values) and the cc-$V_m$-LFP displays an higher correlation coefficient (c=0.71) and a clear statistical relationship (p=0.005).

Importantly, this increased statistical dependency demonstrates that not only the occurence of the rhythmic activity explains the correlation between the $V_m$ and the pLFP, but more generally the variability in network states (i.e. also the variability in non-rhythmic states). Cell 2 in Figure All provides an example of such a phenomena, it exhibits a strong variability in terms of non-rhythmic states and a relatively low occurence of rhythmic activity (e.g. lower than Cell 6), and still, display a high correlation coefficient (cc-$V_m$-pLFP=0.66).

*** Animals 
Experimental procedures involving animals have been approved by the IIT Animal Welfare Body and by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization # 34/2015-PR and 125/2012-B), in accordance with the National legislation (D.Lgs. 26/2014) and the European legislation (European Directive 2010/63/EU). Experiments were performed on young-adult (4-6 weeks old, either sex) C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, Calco, Italy). The animals were housed in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle in singularly ventilated cages, with access to food and water ad libitum.

*** Simultaneous extra- and intracellular recordings in awake mice

The experimental procedure for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice have been previously described (Zucca et al., 2017). Briefly, custom metal plate where fixed on young (P22-P24) mice skull two weeks before the experimental sessions. After a 2-3 days recovery period, mice were habituated to sit quietly on the experimental setup for at least 7-10 days (one session per day and gradually increasing session duration). The day of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with 2.5\% isofluorane and a small craniotomy (0.5x0.5 mm) was opened over the somatosensory cortex and a 30 minutes long recovery period was provided to the animal before starting the recordings. Brain surface was kept moist with a HEPES-buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Extracellular recordings were performed by lowering a glass pipette filled with aCSF into the tissue with the deeper tip placed at $\sim$300 mm from pial surface. Simultaneous current-clamp patch-clamp recordings were carried out on superficial pyramidal neurons (100– 350 mm). 3–6 MΩ borosilicate glass pipettes (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 140, MgCl2 1, NaCl 8, Na2ATP 2, Na3GTP 0.5, HEPES 10, Tris-phosphocreatine 10 to pH 7.2 with KOH. Electrical signals were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 10 kHz, digitized at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1440 and stored with pClamp 10 (RRID:SCR\_011323, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). 

*** Wavelet Transform

Our signal processing pipeline of the extracellular potential was based on the wavelet transform. We implemented a wavelet transform based on the Morlet wavelet, i.e. on the waveform:

\begin{equation}
M_{w_0}(f, t) = C_{w_0}(f) \cdot e^{2 i \pi f t} \cdot e^{-\big(\frac{\sqrt{2} \pi f t}{w_0}\big)^2}
\label{eq:Morlet}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the frequency of the wavelet and $w_0$ the decay parameter of the envellope. Following "standards in wavelet analysis", we kept a value of $w_0$=6 all along the study. The coefficient $C_{f, w_0}$ is the normalization coefficient of the wavelet. Note that, to keep a meaningful link with the physical units of the signal, we did not normalize the wavelet with respect to itself, but with respect to a sinusoid (otherwise the wavelet transform with standard normalization of a sinusoid of frequency $f$ and amplitude 1 has a value greater than 1 at the frequency $f$). The wavelet normalization coefficient is defined, for a wavelet frequency $f$ and an extent $w_0$, by:

\begin{equation}
C_{w_0}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cos (2 \pi f s) \cdot \overline{M_{w_0}(f, s)} \cdot ds = 
\frac{w_0}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi } f} \Big( 1 + e^{\frac{(w_0)^2}{2}} \Big)
\end{equation}


The transform was implemented by a convolution between the signal $S(t)$ and the complex conjuguate of the Morlet wavelet (Equation \label{eq:Morlet}):

\begin{equation}
W(f, t) = \int_{-L}^L S(t) \cdot \overline{M_{w_0}(f, t-s)} ds
\label{eq:Morlet}
\end{equation}

From which the power and the phase at time $t$ of a given frequency $f$ in the signal can be extracted by taking the norm and argument of the complex number $W(f, t)$.

*** Computing the pLFP signal

We consider a frequency band spanning [$f_0/w_0$, $f_0 \cdot w_0$], where $f_0$ is a root frequency and $w_0$ the width parameter of the band. We take a set of $N$=20 wavelets uniformly spanning this band (i.e. evenly space from $f_0/w_0$ to $f_0 \cdot w_0$). The pLFP signal consists in the sum over $N$ of the $k$ wavelet powers of frequency $f_k \in [f_0/w_0, f_0 \cdot w_0]$  , i.e.:

\begin{equation}
pLFP(t) = \sum_{k \in [1,N]} \frac{\| W(f_k, t) \|}{N}
\label{eq:pLFP}
\end{equation}

*** Data Analysis and Statistics

Data were analyzed with SciPy (Oliphant, 2007). Experimental data were translated to the Python format using Neo (RRID:SCR\_000634). 

*** Software implementation

We implemented the described analysis into a publicly available software, available at \url{https://github.com/yzerlaut/Waking_State_Index}. The software contains the described algorithm, a graphical user interface and the support to a few electrophysiological data formats.

(a) The Morlet wavelet at different frequencies (real and imaginary parts as plain and dashed lines respectively). (b) Time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. Note that the chosen normalization (normalizing with respect to a sinusoid rather than the wavelet itself) insures that the amplitude of a modulated signals is kept in the amplitude of the wavelet transform.

*** Normalization of the Wavelet Transform

*** FIGURE: Dependency on the $\alpha$ parameter for the link between the granularity of the pLFP-defined networks states and the granularity of the $V_m$ fluctuations
#+options : {'label':'SuppGranul', 'width':0.99}
From left to right, we increase the $\alpha$ parameter: (a) $\alpha$=1 (b) $\alpha$=2.3 (c) $\alpha$=3.7 (d) $\alpha$=5. Note that despite an increase in the NSI range of observed low-frequency activity (when we raise $\alpha$, more low pLFP amplitude events are classified as Rhythmic, thus extending the NSI range of variations toward low values) the relationship to the depolarization level is poorly affected. On the other hand, at all $\alpha$, the Non-Rhythmic events have a depolarization level exhibiting a steep dependency to the NSI level.
